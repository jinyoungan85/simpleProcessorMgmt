## About
The goal of this Python code is to simulate different scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority) on processes with various attributes such as processID, arrivalTime, burstTime, and priority. The code collects the result of each scheduling algorihm visualize it in a bar plot for easier comparison.

## Getting Started
